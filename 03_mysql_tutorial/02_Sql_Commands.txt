---------------------
Commands in SQL
-----------------------










1.If you want to create a database :-
   
   CREATE DATABASE DATABASE_NAME ;

(
  Rules for creating a database are :-
   1. Space not allowed
   2. special character not allowed
   3. Numeric in front is not allowed >> example 12anshu X
   4. Reserved words are not allowed >> example database , create ..etc
)








2. If you want to see all the databases created till now :-


    SHOW DATABASES ;










3. If you want to go into the database or use database :-

    USE DATABASE_NAME;








4. If you want to delete a database then :-

    DROP DATABASE DATABASE_NAME ;









5. If you want to create a Normal table :-

   CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME
   ( NAME VARCHAR(80) , 
     AGE INT(10) ,
     FEES DESC(10,2) ,
     ADDRESS VARCHAR(70) ) ;





5.1 If you want to add constraints in your table :=
    
    First let's see some constraints Details :=
    
    he following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

    NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
    UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
    PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
    FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
    CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
    DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
    CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly


    Syntax
    __________
    
    CREATE TABLE table_name
    (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
    );


    Example
    __________

     create table student
    -> (
    -> roll int(30) PRIMARY KEY ,
    -> name char(60) NOT NULL ,
    -> class int(30) DEFAULT(12),
    -> age int(30) check(age>=16),
    -> admin int(60) NOT NULL UNIQUE
    -> );






6. If want to get the list of all the tables you have created :-
  
   SHOW TABLES;





7. If you want to see the structure of your table :-
  
   DESCRIBE TABLE_NAME ;
        OR
   DESC TABLE_NAME ;






8. If you want delete a table then :-

   DROP TABLE TABLE_NAME;




9. If you want to insert data in the table :-

   INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME ( NAME , AGE , FEES , ADDRESS )
   VALUES ('RAMDAS' , 18 , 1000 , 'DURGAPUR' ) ;
    
   ( Important note -> String such as name should be written insided )

 insert into student
    -> ( roll , name , email )
    -> values
    -> ( 1 , 'Anshu' , 'alp@gmail.com') ,
    -> ( 2 , 'Palku' , 'iamsocute@gmail.com');





10. If you want to see the whole table :-

    SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME ;





11. If you want to see only one column of the table then :-

    SELECT COLUMN_NAME_1 , COLUMN_NAME_2 FROM TABLE_NAME ;
    
   ( Important note -> you add as many as column you want )






12. If you want to see some particular details from the table then you can use     where clause
    
   SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE (CONDITION) ;
   
   Example -> SELECT * FROM INFO WHERE FEES >= 600 ;



12. IF we want to see different or distinct data from attribute : 

   select distinct roll from student ;





13. If you want to see some particular details from the table then you can
    use between and not between.

   SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE AGE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 ;

  ( Note -> You can use any details in place of age )




14. The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

    The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.

    01 > To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:
          
          ALTER TABLE table_name 
          ADD column_name datatype; 

          Example:-
           ALTER TABLE student
           ADD email varchar(90) UNIQUE ;
   
   02 >  To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):
          
          ALTER TABLE table_name
          DROP COLUMN column_name;
          
          The following SQL deletes the "Email" column from the "Customers" table:
          
          Example:-
          
          ALTER TABLE student
          DROP COLUMN Email;

   03 >  ALTER TABLE table_name
         MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
         
         
         ALTER TABLE table_name
         MODIFY column_name datatype;


15. SELECT Statement
    
    1 > Using Arithmetic operator 
    
    Example 5:-
    SELECT  age , age+10 FROM student; 


    2 > Operator Precedence ->>> The basic operators used in SQL are * / + - 
        
        Operators of the same priority are evaluated From Left to right 
        Parentheses are used to force prioritized evaluation. 
        
        Example :-
        SELECT  age, 12*age+100 FROM student; 

   3 >   
   SELECT age+2 "Your Age" from stud ;
    

     
 Functions starts from here :-

14. If you want to see sums of some details from the table then you can
    use >> sum >> function.

   SELECT SUM(COLUMN_NAME) FROM TABLE_NAME ;

15. If you want to see average of some details from the table then you can
    use >> avg >> function.

   SELECT AVG(COLUMN_NAME) FROM TABLE_NAME ;
 
16. If you want to see mininum value of some details from the table then you       can use >> min >> function.

   SELECT MIN(COLUMN_NAME) FROM TABLE_NAME ;

16. If you want to see maximum value of some details from the table then you       can use >> max >> function.

   SELECT MAX(COLUMN_NAME) FROM TABLE_NAME ;

17. If you want to delete any info from the table then .

    DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE CONDITION ;

    Example -> DELETE FROM INFO WHERE CONDITION ;

18. If you want to add auto creament to create an unique id then :-
    
    CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME
    ( SL_NO int(10) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY , 
      NAME VARCHAR(80) , 
      AGE INT(10) ,
      FEES DESC(10,2) ,
      ADDRESS VARCHAR(70) ) ;
